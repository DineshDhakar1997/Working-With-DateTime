# Working-With-DateTime
1) Write a function in python that inputs a dataframe and identify which columns have date in them. Using these date columns make new columns which are difference between these columns taking 2 at a time. (for instance if there is date1, date2, date3 columns, output should be like date1-date2, date2-date3, date1-date3). 

Thing to consider

Date column might have some invalid entries in them. 
Date can be of different format throughout the column.
Make a dummy dataset by yourself.


2)Write a function in python that take dataframe as input and drop columns having Pearson correlation more than 0.85
Thing to consider
Code should drop least amount of variable as possible.

Make a dummy dataset by yourself or pass any publicly available dataset to test out your logic
